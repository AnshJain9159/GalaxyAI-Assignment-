# Expected Deliverables

- Fully functional AI Video-to-Video Transformation Tool deployed on Vercel.
- Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Comprehensive error handling (including edge cases for file upload, API failures, and webhook handling).

# Developer Guidelines

To ensure consistency, maintainable code, and efficient collaboration, your submission must strictly follow these mandatory technical guidelines. Submissions that do not meet these standards will not be approved or considered.

⚠️ **Note**: If you do not have sufficient credits on FAL to use the Hunyuan-Video model, you can demonstrate your implementation using any alternative image-to-image model instead of this video-to-video model.

The AI Video-to-Video Transformation Tool utilizes the FAL API (Hunyuan-Video Model) to apply advanced video transformations. Users upload a source video and specify transformation parameters to generate a stylized or enhanced output video.

The UI/UX must match the design and functionality of this reference: [Video Stylization AI Video Creation Generator](https://video-stylization-ai-video-creation-generator.vercel.app/).

## Workflow

### 1. Input Data

Users provide:
- **Source Video**: Uploaded via Uploadcare (validate for supported video formats).
- **Parameters**: All customization options offered by the API.

### 2. Backend Processing

#### Step 1: Upload Source Video
- The source video is uploaded to Cloudinary for secure storage.

#### Step 2: Call the FAL API
- The Hunyuan-Video Model is invoked with:
  - The Cloudinary URL of the source video.
  - The selected transformation parameters.
  - A webhook URL to receive the transformed video asynchronously.

#### Step 3: Webhook Handling
- The webhook receives the transformed video from the FAL API.
- The processed video is uploaded to Cloudinary.

### 3. Webhook Handling

- Implement a webhook endpoint to:
FAL  - Upload the transformed video to Cloudinary.
  - Store the generated video URL and metadata in MongoDB.

### 4. History API

- Provide an endpoint to fetch user history, including:
  - Source Video URL.
  - Transformation Parameters.
  - Generated Video URL.

# Key Notes

### Validation

- Ensure uploaded source videos are:
  - In a supported format (MP4, MOV, etc.).
  - Within acceptable size limits.
- Validate transformation parameters before sending requests to FAL API.

### Error Handling

- Handle API errors such as:
  - Invalid video URLs.
  - Processing failures (e.g., incorrect format).
- Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or failures.

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize video uploads, API calls, and retrieval to reduce latency.
- Use asynchronous processing for webhook handling to prevent blocking.

### Security Best Practices

- Use HTTPS and secure API keys when communicating with FAL, Cloudinary, and MongoDB.
- Validate webhook requests to prevent unauthorized access.
